## Introduction
This study developed a dermatology detection system that can classify seven skin diseases by using the DermaMNIST dataset. We used a total of four models and compared the accuracy and AUC of the models and found that VGG11+RESIZE is the most effective model, which achieves an accuracy of 79.8% and an AUC of 94.0%. Thus, this paper contributes to dermatology screening and can contribute to being a key tool to help clinicians predict, prevent, and manage skin diseases in the era of digital medicine. However, the current accuracy of the system needs to be improved and there is still a possibility of error. In the future, based on improving the accuracy, research can continue to incorporate treatment protocols tailored to the patient's condition to better assist clinicians in treating their patients.
